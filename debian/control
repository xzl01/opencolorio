Description: complete color management solution - development
 OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared
 towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects
 and computer animation. OCIO provides a straightforward and
 consistent user experience across all supporting applications while
 allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration options suitable
 for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the Academy
 Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
 supporting many popular formats.
 .
 OpenColorIO is released as version 2.0 and has been in development
 since 2003. OCIO represents the culmination of years of production
 experience earned on such films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up
 (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009), Alice in Wonderland
 (2010), and many more. OpenColorIO is natively supported in
 commercial applications like Katana, Mari, Nuke, Maya, Houdini,
 Silhouette FX, and others.
 .
 OpenColorIO is free and open source software and one of several
 projects actvively sponsored by the ASWF (Academy Software
 Foundation).
 .
 This package provides the development files used to build
 applications using OpenColorIO.
